For instance, it surpasses an ensemble of the strongest baselines in 2.8 seconds compared to 4 hours of tuning.</p> </li> <li> <p> Superior Accuracy</p> <p>TabPFN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods like gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) on datasets with up to 10,000 samples. It achieves higher accuracy and better performance metrics across a range of classification and regression tasks.</p> </li> <li> <p> Robustness</p> <p>The model demonstrates robustness to various dataset characteristics, including uninformative features, outliers, and missing values, maintaining high performance where other methods struggle.</p> </li> <li> <p> Generative Capabilities</p> <p>As a generative transformer-based model, TabPFN can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, generate synthetic data, estimate densities, and learn reusable embeddings. This makes it versatile for various applications beyond standard prediction tasks.</p> </li> <li> <p> Sklearn Interface</p> <p>TabPFN follows the interfaces provided by scikit-learn, making it easy to integrate into existing workflows and utilize familiar functions for fitting, predicting, and evaluating models.</p> </li> <li> <p> Minimal Preprocessing</p> <p>The model handles various types of raw data, including missing values and categorical variables, with minimal preprocessing. This reduces the burden on users to perform extensive data preparation.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#tabpfn-integrations","title":"TabPFN Integrations","text":"<ul> <li> <p> API Client</p> <p>The fastest way to get started with TabPFN.
