## Citing

## Acknowledgments

We express our gratitude to the following individuals for their valuable contributions and support:

Eddie Bergman for his assistance with the evaluation of TabPFN and for his efforts in improving the code quality and documentation. His contributions were instrumental in benchmarking TabPFN and ensuring the reproducibility of our results.

Liam Shi Bin Hoo, Anshul Gupta, and David Otte for their work on the Inference Server, which enables the fast deployment of TabPFN without the need for a local GPU. Their efforts have greatly enhanced the accessibility and usability of TabPFN.

David Schnurr and Kai Helli for their work on visualization, and David Schnurr for his specific contributions related to handling missing values. Lukas Schweizer for his work on exploring the Random Forest preprocessing for TabPFN further.

Andreas Müller for the insightful discussions related to TabPFN training and for his guidance on identifying and mitigating biases in the prior. His expertise has been invaluable in refining the TabPFN methodology.

Stefan Stäglich for his diligent maintenance of the cluster infrastructure.

We also extend our thanks to Claudia Langenberg and Maik Pietzner for providing insights on medical applications.
